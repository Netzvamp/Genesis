# Security Policy

At first, it is necessary to make it very clear where our library is supported

| Python Version | Supported          |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| 3.12.x         | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.11.x         | :white_check_mark: |
| 3.10.x         | :warning:          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Any report must be made via issue in the official repository of the project, so that it can be discussed with the community and the appropriate implementations are made in the library.
