# Installation Guide

To start using Genesis, we recommend using the latest version of Python.

Install Genesis in your environment using `pip`:

```bash
pip install genesis
```

With Genesis installed, you can now explore the available guides in the [documentation homepage](/Genesis) to learn how to use it.
